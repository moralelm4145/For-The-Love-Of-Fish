    <p><b>Pescatarians</b> are like vegetarians. Their diet consists of fish, seafood, vegetables, dairy, and eggs.</p>       
<p>Pescatarians are sure to stay away from any red meats and poultry. Basically, no meat except for fish.</p>
<br />
    <h2>A Brief History Lesson</h2>
    <br />
    <p>The word was coined in the early '90s. Coming from the italian word for fish, <i>pesce</i>, and the word, <i>vegetarian</i>.</p>
    <p>Some may spell it as pescetarian as well, which is also acceptable. Another description for it, is <i>pesco-vegetarian</i>.</p>
    <p>The diet is a largely plant-based diet that consists of whole grains, nuts, legumes, produce, and healthy fats with seafood being the main 
    protein source. Many pescatarians still eat dairy and eggs as well.</p>
    <br />
